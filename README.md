### Description
Project "Koi" is a simple boid simulation using the rules of avoidance, cohesion and alignment based on this [resource](https://cs.stanford.edu/people/eroberts/courses/soco/projects/2008-09/modeling-natural-systems/boids.html). It simulates a small koi pond, where fishes swim around in a realistic motion and forms schools. There isn't much interactivity, but it is quite a mesmerizing sight to look at. ðŸ¤©
